# Classification-of-Clothing-images
In this problem, you will be using an output of a bottleneck layer from pre-trained CNN as input features for a few simple classifiers. The CNN provided was trained with the Fashion MNIST dataset which consists of 10 classes of 28x28 grayscale images; this dataset is very similar to MNIST in that there are 10 classes with images that are the same size as MNIST and in fact even the training and test set sizes are the same (60,000 and 10,000 respectively). However, the classes are not the digits 0 through 9. Instead the classes are:  T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover,  Dress,  Coat,  Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot
