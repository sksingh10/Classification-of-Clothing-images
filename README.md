# Classification-of-Clothing-images
Representation Learning   Before getting started, please put the attached file `pretrained_convnet.pt` in the same directory as this notebook.  Recall from lecture the "crumpled paper analogy": in a neural net, as you progress through the layers from input to output, the layers should be "unfolding the original space" to disentangle the classes. When you get to the layer before the classifier, you should've changed the data representation into something that makes classification easy. **We will refer to the layer before the classifier in the neural net as the bottleneck layer.**  In this problem, you will be using an output of a bottleneck layer from pre-trained CNN as input features for a few simple classifiers. The CNN provided was trained with the Fashion MNIST dataset which consists of 10 classes of 28x28 grayscale images; this dataset is very similar to MNIST in that there are 10 classes with images that are the same size as MNIST and in fact even the training and test set sizes are the same (60,000 and 10,000 respectively). However, the classes are not the digits 0 through 9. Instead the classes are:  T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover,  Dress,  Coat,  Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot
